The Association has represented players within Ireland since the League’s formation in 1961 and through experience has gained the knowledge of knowing how to look after the most important people in Irish Football – you, the player.<br>Our Association is solely a player-based organisation and it will always put the best interests of the players first. The PFAI has a representative on the Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) which deals with disputes and appeals with the football authorities. The PFAI is a member of FIFPro, the World Players’ Union, and it is also a branch of SIPTU, so any problems the Association deals with on the players’ behalf will also have the backing of these two organisations.<br>The PFAI was set-up and run as a part-time organisation up until 2002 when funding from FIFPro and office space from SIPTU enabled the Association to operate on a full-time basis. Our Association administer the Irish Professional Footballers’ Education and Support Trust which was set up by the PFAI and the FAI to provide financial and educational assistance for past and present League of Ireland players. The PFAI is a founder member of the Show Racism the Red Card (Ireland) campaign which tackles discrimination in the game.<br>Our Association recently set up a Player Management Agency service for international and domestic based players at schoolboy and professional level. The aim is to represent players and to ensure that their best interests are served throughout their careers enabling them to flourish and achieve their full potential. Close attention will be given to ensure that all aspects and agreements of a player’s contract are watertight. This booklet provides details of the different aspects of the PFAI and shows that the PFAI is able to offer advice, guidance and representation on many aspects of being a player in the League of Ireland, internationally or abroad. The Association has and will always give you the best guidance and services.<br><br><b>Stephen McGuinness</b><br>General Secretary, PFAI.<br><br><b>About the Agency</b><br>The PFAI negotiates with football clubs on a daily basis to protect and serve the interests of all professional players and the Player Management Agency department is an extension of that premise. The department provides hands-on representation for players at every stage of their career as well as offering ethical best advice at all times. It is important that a player seeks advice and representation in contractual negotiations with a club, and the quality of that advice and representation is crucial. The sole aim of our Agency will always be the best interests of the player. Regulations introduced by FIFA require players and clubs to deal only with licensed agents for transfer and contract negotiations.The PFAI has a designated officer whom is a licensed players’ agent and is able to advise and represent players on all aspects of their contracts at the time of re-signing or when being transferred. In Stephen McGuinness, the PFAI has a leading representative who has negotiated at the highest level and has made a major impact on the working conditions and benefits for all players. In an industry where a player’s life can change in a short space of time from being a youth player to a professional player with a lucrative contract, sound financial advice is essential.We are delighted that many of our members throughout the League of Ireland and the Schoolboys Leagues have become clients of the PFAI and thus have ensured that their futures are secure.<br>A major benefit to any client of the Agency is that the majority of services that a player requires are provided internally and not out-sourced to other companies.<br><br><b>Benefits</b><br><br>The PFAI has many benefits outlined below as well as three offices in Dublin’s National Sports Campus in Abbotstown, Dublin. The PFAI team will provide assistance on every aspect of a footballer’s career, letting the player concentrate on playing.<br>As part of the continued expansion of the PFAI’s services we are representing underage players when signing a new or extended professional contract or scholars contract in the UK. Our solicitor, Stuart Gilhooly, will finalise all contracts where required. He is a registered lawyer with the English Football Association; his registration number is RLG728 and he is in a position to assist in the provision of football agency services.<br>The PFAI is in a unique position as we are directly linked to the English PFA and PFA Scotland through FIFPro, the world players’ union, and we can also assist in any difficulties players may have in relation to settling in at a club as we have direct links to the FAI’s Player Welfare Officer in the UK.<br>Our Association will also be the first point of contact for players who want to pursue or who return from the UK after a professional career in Ireland or who return after a scholar’s contract or professional contract. The PFAI will work to find employment for all players and will help fund education, legal and accountancy advice.<br>The PFAI is a non-profit organisation and isn’t driven like a lot of football agents to make as much money for themselves as possible and are not concerned at all if the player’s career does not work out. Our only concern is the player and his welfare both on and off the field.<br>The senior Irish international team are all members of the PFAI and this shows the level of our professionalism, as well as the respect in which our Association is held.<br><br><b>The Team</b><br><br><img class='static-image-small' src='images/content/stephen.png'><br><b>STEPHEN MCGUINNESS</b>, General Secretary.<br>Tel: <a href='tel:00353 86 605 6729'>086 605 6729</a><br>Email: stephen@pfai.ie<br><br>He’s a former Club Captain of Home Farm, St Patrick’s Athletic and Dundalk.
